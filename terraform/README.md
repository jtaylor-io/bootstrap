## How to: Manage AWS infrastructure using Terraform

### Setup [Terraform (üêî) S3 Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) using Terraform (ü•ö)

The supplied Terraform [bootstrap template](./terraform-aws-bootstrap.tf) and these
accompanying instructions will help setup the required AWS resources:

- [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket to store Terraform state file
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to manage concurrent access to Terraform state file
- [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) policy to enable access to backend resources

### Installation Instructions

#### Prerequisites

- Install [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) for your platform
- Have an existing AWS account id (or [create a new account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup))
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for your platform

#### Provision Resources

##### Initialise terraform

```shell
terraform init
```

##### Apply terraform

```shell
terraform apply
```

##### Input AWS account id

```shell
var.aws_account_id
  AWS account to use. [Mandatory]

  Enter a value: # TODO: enter your account id here when prompted
```

##### Review and approve plan

```shell
... <Terraform Plan omitted> ...

Plan: 5 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: # TODO: review the Terraform Plan output and type 'yes' if it looks good

... <Terraform Apply logs omitted> ...

Apply complete! Resources: 5 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

##### Create Terraform backend config

```shell
./make-s3-backend-hcl.sh > terraform-backend.tf
```

##### Migrate local Terraform state file to S3

```shell
terraform init -migrate-state # answer "yes" when prompted to copy state to new backend
```

### Uninstall instructions

#### Destroy Bootstrap Resources

In order to cleanly remove all bootstrapped resources, the state file needs to be
migrated from S3 to a local copy. This allows a terraform destroy to be issued
to remove the bootstrapped resources. Instructions included in a comment in the
generated terraform-backend.tf file are repeated below:

```shell
#       If you need to migrate the Terraform state file back to being local
#       e.g. if you want to remove the Terraform S3 Backend bootstrap resources,
#       then remove the terraform backend s3 block below and uncomment the terraform
#       backend local block below. Then run:
#
#       $> terraform init -migrate-state # answer yes to prompt
#
#       If you are trying to destroy the bootstrapped resources, you will need
#       to MANUALLY REMOVE any state files (including any old versions)
#       left in the state bucket (either via AWS console or cli). This step has
#       been deliberately left manual, due to the severity of the action.
#       Once the state bucket is empty, you can safely destroy the bootstrap
#       resources using the command below:
#
#       $> terraform destroy # answer yes to prompt
#
# terraform {
#   backend \"local\" {
#     path = \"terraform.tfstate\"
#   }
# }
```
