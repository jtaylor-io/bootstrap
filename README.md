## Motivation

> There are new shiny things everywhere!
> \- _Anon. Magpie_

The tooling, frameworks, libraries status quo for most technologies is frequently in flux.

On the one hand, this can feel empowering and thought provoking, providing new ways
of thinking about and (hopefully) solving a given problem.
On the other, it can feel like a distraction from actually tackling the business
problem in front of you, not to mention a little tiring.

The intended purpose of this repo is to get these two hands high-fiving! 🫸💥🫷

I want this to be a place to track the evolution of project templates I find
useful to solve actual problems.
