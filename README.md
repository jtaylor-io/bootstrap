## Motivation

The tooling, frameworks, libraries status quo for most technologies is frequently in flux.

- On the one âœ‹, this can feel empowering and thought provoking, providing new ways
  of thinking about and (hopefully) solving a given problem.

- On the other âœ‹, it can feel like a distraction from actually tackling the business
  problem in front of you, not to mention a little tiring.

- The intended purpose of this repo is to get these two hands high-fiving ðŸ«¸ðŸ’¥ðŸ«·

I want this to be a place to track the evolution of project templates I find
useful to solve actual problems.
